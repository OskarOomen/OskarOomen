# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Oskar

I'm an 18-year-old self-taught developer and incoming student at UC Berkeley, planning to double major in Math and Computer Science.

I've built across different domains â€” from web tools to full-stack apps â€” but my main interest lies in machine learning and its applications.

### ðŸš€ Projects & Highlights

- ðŸ§  Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect pneumonia in dogs from chest X-rays, accepted to two international science fairs:
  - **Exporecerca Jove** (Spain)
  - **Genius Olympiad** (USA)
- ðŸ§® Created a custom math tutoring website and taught 3 long-term clients

### ðŸ”¬ Interests & Stack

- Python (primary language)
- ML frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- Backend: FastAPI, Flask
- Cloud: Google Cloud Run, AWS (S3, DynamoDB)

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Most of my current projects are private â€” happy to share upon request 
- Focused on building maintainable code and understanding ML from the ground up
